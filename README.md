## General Info
***
This project was created for the Data Security exam. Using the [Pet Shop tutorial](http://truffleframework.com/tutorial) as a starting point, I developed an avatar marketplace. Currently, there are no markets within the Cosmos Ecosystem for selling images that depict astronauts. Hence, I decided to create a cosmonaut marketplace, which includes astronauts specifically for the Cosmos ecosystem.
